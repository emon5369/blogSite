## Appwrite Setup

This project uses [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) for authentication, database management, and file storage. Follow these steps to set up Appwrite for this project:

### Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Log in with your Appwrite account.
2. Create a new project and note down the **Project ID**.

### Step 2: Setup Authentication

1. Navigate to the **Auth** section of your project.
2. Enable **Email/Password Authentication** in the settings for user registration and login.

### Step 3: Setup Database Collections

1. Go to the **Database** section.
2. Create a collection named `articles`.
3. Add the following attributes:
   - `title` (string)
   - `content` (string)
   - `featuredImage` (string) - for storing the uploaded image file IDs
   - `status` (string)
   - `userId` (string) - to associate posts with users
   
4. From the `articles` collection, go to the "Settings" > "Permissions" > " + Add role" and select "All users". Give this user type "Create", "Read", "Update" and "Delete" permissions.

### Step 4: Setup File Storage

1. Go to the **Storage** section.
2. Create a new bucket for file uploads named `images`.
3. Ensure that authenticated users have permission to upload and delete files.

### Step 5: Install the Appwrite SDK
